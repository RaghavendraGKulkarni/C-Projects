This project gives the implementation of various data stuctures in pure C language. 
The C programs are very easy to handle. 
1) Each program, on execution, provides a menu of operations that are allowed on the Data Structure and a prompt to enter the choice according to the menu.
2) Upon entering the choice, the corresponding output is displayed beneath the menu, followed by the menu again.
3) The menu cycle keeps on repeating until the user enters the choice for 'Exit'.
4) No other operations, except those provided in the menu for a particular Data Structure, can be performed on it by the program.
